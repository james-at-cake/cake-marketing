Cakewalk Design is a niche design and development studio that is hyper-focussed on crafting winery websites. The company is run by James Davenport in Abbotsford, BC, which is located an hour west of Vancouver. This small agricultural community is birthplace to some of the best wine tech in the world and has a growing agtech community.

James has over 12 years of design and development experience specializing in wine ecommerce and crafting websites for wineries. He has worked on countless projects and thrived creating online experiences for wineries or by partnering with an agency as an ecommerce development specialist.

The team has had a variety of designers, developers, and specialists work for us as a project demands and we've been able to collaborate with some great designers, photographers, and agencies on some stunning projects for wineries. We'd love to collaborate with you on your next great project or idea!
