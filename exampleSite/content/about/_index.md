Cakewalk Design is a niche design and development studio that is hyper-focussed on crafting winery websites. My name is James Davenport and I live in Abbotsford, BC, which is located an hour west of Vancouver. This small agricultural community is the birthplace to some of the best wine tech in the world and has a growing agtech community.

I have over 12 years of design and development experience specializing in wine ecommerce and crafting websites for wineries. I've worked on countless projects and thrived creating online experiences for wineries or by partnering with an agency as an ecommerce development specialist.

I've worked with a variety of designers, developers, and specialists as projects demand and we've been able to collaborate with some great marketers, photographers, and agencies on some stunning projects for wineries. I'd love to collaborate with you on your next great project or idea!
